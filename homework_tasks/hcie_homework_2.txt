Configuration tasks:

1. Configure IS-IS for IPv4 and IPv6 in AS 2 on routers R1-R6 for interfaces loopback0 and 
for gigabitethernet interfaces (exclude ge0/0/1 by R1 and R2).

2.Configure in AS 2 on routers R1, R2, R4, R5, R6 BGP neighbor relathionship with R3 using loopback0 ip address. 
R3 must be RR.
When routers R1, R2, R4, R5, R6 announcing an update to the router R3 should change next-hop address to own loopback0 address.
On R5 and R6 advertise network gi0/0/2 interface (192.168.55.0/24 and 192.168.66.0/24) to BGP.

3. Between R7 located in AS1 and R1 and also between R7 and R2 configure neighbor eBGP relathionship with  using loopback0 ip address.

4.Modify the BGP  attribute on routers in AS2, so that when PC1 and PC2 access the non-directly connected network segments 10.10.X.0/24 (networks) on R7, 
R5 and R6 preferentially select R1 as the next top if X is an odd number, or preferentially select R2 as the next hop if X is an even number. 
Consistency of the round-trip paths does not need to be considered.
Consider what are the possible configuration options to solve this problem.

5.Configure R1 and R7 to establish an EBGP4+ (IPv6 address-family) peer relationship through the direct link, configure R1 and R3 to establish an IBGP4+ (IPv6 address-family)  peer relationship through the loopback 0. 
IPv6 addresses preconfigured on R7, R1, R3.
(See IPv6 address on all routers used command display ipv6 int brief )

6. On R3, import IS-IS IPv6 routes to BGP4+ and on R1 advertise only the route with the prefix of 2000:BD8:0:55:/64  and 2000:BD8:0:66:/64 to R7 with filter-policy command.
