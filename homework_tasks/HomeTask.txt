Configuration tasks:

1. Configure between SW1 and SW2 Eth-trunk in LACP mode with load balance traffic based 
on source and destination MAC address.

2.Configure the link type of interfaces connecting between all switches to trunk, 
and configure the interfaces to allow packets of all VLANs except VLANs 1, 100, 200 to pass through.


3.Configure all switches to run MSTP. Configure the mapping between VLAN 11 and MSTI 11, and configure SW1 as primary root bridge and SW2 as secondary root bridge. 
Configure the mapping between VLAN 12 and MSTI12, and configure SW2 as the primary root bridge and SW1 as secondary root bridge. 
Set the MST region name to LAB, and set the revision level of the MST region to 5.

4. On all other interfaces except the interconnection interfaces between switches configure edge ports.

5. Configure VRRP group  on R1 and R2 is assigned the virtual IP address 192.168.11.1, and functions as the gateway for PC1. 
R1 periodically sends gratuitous ARP packets with sender IP address as 192.168.11.1 and source MAC address as 00-00-5E-00-01-0B. 
The data frames transmitted between PC1 and the gateway are tagged with VLAN 11 (PC sends and receives
untagged frames).

6. Configure VRRP group  on R1 and R2 is assigned the virtual IP address 192.168.12.1, and functions as the gateway for PC2. 
R2 periodically sends gratuitous ARP packets with sender IP address as 192.168.12.1 and source MAC address as 00-00-5E-00-01-0C. 
The data frames transmitted between PC2 and the gateway are tagged with VLAN 12 (PC sends and receives
untagged frames).

7. The router acting as the VRRP master should become master again 3 minute after interface GE0/0/1 goes Up.

8.Configure on R1, R2, R3 OSPF for links between routers and loopbacks interfaces. Disable loopbacks interfaces from sending and  receiving ospf hello packets.

9.(Optional step)Configure NAT on R1 and R2 to translate the private IP address segments 192.168.11.0/24 and 192.168.12.0/24  
to public IP addresses in the range from 200.1.1.101 to 200.1.1.199 on R1 and in the range from 200.2.2.101 to 200.2.2.199 on R2. 
Configure R1 and R2 to access the Internet (Ip address loopback R3)  through GE0/0/2. 
Configure dedicated public IP address 200.1.1.100  for PC1 and 200.2.2.100  for PC2 that provides FTP and HTTP services for the Internet.
