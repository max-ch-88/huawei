Configuration tasks:

1.Enable IS-IS on all Loopback 0 and interconnection interfaces of R1, R2, R3, R4.(pre-configured)

2. Enable OSPF on R5 Loopback 0 and interconnection interfaces of R3 to R5, R5 to R6, R4 to R6.(pre-configured)

3.Import the IP address of Loopback 0 on R6 to OSPF. 
The route from each OSPF NE to Loopback 0 on R6 should contain the internal cost.
 
4.On R3 and R4, import IS-IS and OSPF host routes with the prefix of 172.16.0.0/16 into each other. 
The cost of the imported protocol needs to be inherited. 
Loopback0 interfaces of R4 and R6 must communicate with each other through the optimal path. 
The configuration should have the best scalability to solve issue caused by dual-node bi-directional route importing.
